Validation of the anticholinergic medication index prediction model (ACMI-PM) for use in secondary care settings.

# Lay Summary

One in four older adults admitted to hospital are taking medication with an anticholinergic effect, known
as anticholinergic medication. Anticholinergic medication have been linked with a higher chance of
confusion and suffering a fall. The anticholinergic medication index prediction model is a clinical tool which
calculates a person’s risk of experiencing confusion or a fall whilst living in the community, based on their
medical history and the anticholinergic medication they are taking. This tool has been developed using
anonymised patient data from general practices. The aim of this project is to see if the ACMI-PM can
accurately calculate a person’s risk of developing delirium or suffering a fall during a hospital stay. If this is
the case, it could be used to identify those at higher risk. These people could then be prioritised for a
review of their medication which may result stopping or pausing any anticholinergic medication.
